# Clinton React Portfolio

## Overview
Hello there, this is my portfolio made with React and Next.js and using Material UI interface library to style my site and add interface components. While, I do prefer to use CSS/SASS I enjoyed using this library, and can defintely see the merit in using it. I wanted to use it to get familiar with these types of libraries and how they work inside React. 

This site features the ability to fill out a form to contact me, it then sends that form data to firebase which then emails me to let me know I have a new form submission. This sort of implementation was new to me at the time and it was fun to learn how to do this. A very useful thing to know, I think.

## Why did I make this project? Why did I use React to make a portfolio?
I wanted to make a portfolio that emphasized some of the developement side projects that I have created over the past few months. My live portfolio website [clinton-gorda.com](www.clinton-gorda.com) features some of the designs I have created, but for this particular website I wanted to focus on the development side of things. I made it with React because I am always trying to improve my React skills. 

I love building websites and practicing. I love taking the things I have learned and applying them to my projects. This site is no different. Since this is more of a static site, it really helped me get used to styling and laying out elements and components with Material UI in React and Nextjs. I am used to doing things certain ways in HTML and plain CSS, so it was great to learn how to do certain things using front-end libraries such as React.

## Project Status
It is currently complete in terms of layout and overall look. I am quite happy with how it looks but it does need a little bit of work in terms of where its at. There are some things that need to implemented and fixed and I will get to those when I get the time. 

## When I get more time, I am going to work on
  - Adding validation to the submit form
  - Ensuring mobile responsiveness
  - Adding a Resume link
  - I would like to cut some of the content into separate components at some point as well to keep things lean.
  - Add linking to the header to bring the user to the desired component/section
  - Adding more development projects to the site

## Challenges I faced while making this
One of the main challenges with this site was learning how to use MaterialUI. I still wouldn't consider myself an expert with the library, I do feel confident in using it and other similar interface/component libraries in the future. I find it similar to Tailwind, which is another library that I like to use from time to time in my projects.

## Useful Links
Once the site is complete I will be deploying it and using Vercel hosting.
